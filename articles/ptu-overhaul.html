                    Where did this come from?
                </h1>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    So me and my friends wanted to play a Pokemon Tabletop RPG, and we chose
                    Pokemon Tabletop United (PTU for short). This game is fun and crunchy. And
                    my friends didn&#8217;t especially like crunching numbers during sessions,
                    so the game ended up losing popularity in our playgroup.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr" class="side-note">
                    <b>Crunchy</b>
                    <br/>
                    This is by no means a bad thing, in my opinion it speaks of the nature of
                    the game. It also sort of works like a scale, the more and more complex
                    math you need to do during your playing session, the crunchier the game
                    becomes. If in a given system,I need to add up four different situational
                    bonuses to roll a hit, then that system is crunchier than one where I need
                    to roll a single die with just one static bonus.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    As an example, Powered By the Apocalypse games have little crunch.
                    Shadowrun is crunchy. Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3.5e is crunchier than 5th
                    Edition and Pokemon Tabletop United is crunchier than the version I wrote.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    We were having fun while playing, so in an attempt to recover the group's
                    attention I developed my own PTU version. It all started with suggestions I
                    had and were piling up in my head. Those ended up as whole cuts and changes
                    to the original game and in the following sections I will go over the most
                    relevant, detailing my thought process behind my decisions.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h2 dir="ltr">
                    Divided by 5
                </h2>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    This was the kickoff change, the one that set out the chain reaction.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The game is about Pokemon, and the pokemon in those games level up from
                    level 1 to 100. This means that if I were to adapt Pokemon to a d20 system,
                    it would make sense to develop a d20 system and then multiply it by 5, then
                    everything looks one-hundred-ish. This may or may not be the way the
                    developers designed the game, it's just a pattern I definitely noticed.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Then the general smallest bonus unit in the game is a +5. There are some
                    exceptions, but this is a rule, and the other bonuses are generally
                    multiples of five.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Implementing this change was fairly straightforward. Just divide most of
                    the numerical values by 5 and we get the simplified bonus.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    In the same vein, I simplified the damage bases. Pokemon games have a lot
                    of attacks, called Moves, PTU has all of those moves as wells but, beside
                    the dice rolled for a move, there is a number which can be referenced in a
                    table where it tells you how many dice you would roll when using that Move.
                    Why? Well because there are bonuses and penalties to the damage base of the
                    move. So you get a +1, go to the chart, get the dice you need to roll and
                    then calculate your additional situational bonuses.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    To reduce the crunchiness, which was my aim here, I removed all bonuses to
                    the Damage Base. Even more, Damage Base is no longer a mechanic surfaced to
                    the players, it&#8217;s a design tool I used to balance and compare similar
                    Moves. No abilities or features alter Damage Base anymore and the Moves now
                    only list the number of dice the player should roll, if any.
                </p>
                <h2 dir="ltr">
                    <br/>
                    Injury System
                </h2>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    It's an additional health point system. If any Pokemon were to accrue
                    enough injuries, independently of their HP, they faint. Injuries heal at a
                    different rate than HP and are acquired by meeting different conditions,
                    like receiving heavy blows.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Injuries reduce the pokemon&#8217;s maximum HP. So a pokemon with healing
                    abilities would eventually get so many injuries that it&#8217;d make it
                    impossible for them to heal up enough to sustain the damage they are
                    taking. So it is sort of a countermeasure to recovery strategies.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    I took a different approach. I removed injuries and tried to handle
                    recovery strategies by limiting them through the Moves Frequency mechanic.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Moves have a Frequency, they can be used a number of times at different
                    intervals. At-will can be used freely, scene moves can be used a number of
                    times per fight and daily moves a number of times per day. Healing moves
                    fall generally under the daily category, because they influence HP, which
                    is a resource restored by resting.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    <br/>
                    So I made the compromise of removing the Injury system but, in consequence,
                    I had to be extra careful with the number of uses allowed healing moves.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h2 dir="ltr">
                    Situational vs Significant, Volatile vs Static
                </h2>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    There are a lot of sources for Bonuses in PTU. Moves, equipment,
                    consumables, food, abilities, features, edges. And&#8230; I think
                    that&#8217;s it, but I might be missing a few. But the crunchy part is not
                    the number of sources, it&#8217;s the fact that they may come and go or
                    that they might be active due to certain criteria being met. And multiple
                    of them could be active or inactive at the same time, having to tweak the
                    numbers every turn.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    And there is this concept of reducing the amount of headspace required by
                    the players. In this case, it means that the player is
                    trying to keep track of all of this situational bonuses and penalties and
                    trying to remember when they need to apply and when they expire. This takes
                    up space in their minds, which might be fun for some players, but it is a
                    consequence of crunchy mechanics.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    If the bonuses were only static (which many but not all are), the game
                    would need some prep-work but most of the playtime would be just
                    referencing the numbers of the sheets and rolling. But the bonuses change,
                    which means a lot of on-the-fly calculations.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    So to reduce the crunchiness here, I took a few pages from Dungeons &amp;
                    Dragons 5th edition. Bonuses are now only static or significant (and
                    unique). Static bonuses make you work up-front, so they are good for this
                    purpose. The other method is making them significant (and unique). You can
                    increase significance by turning the bonus number into an action, like
                    rolling a die. The Advantage and Disadvantage mechanic is an example of
                    significant bonuses in dungeons and dragons.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                <p class="side-note">
                    <b>Advantage and Disadvantage</b>
                    <br/>
                    Characters rolling with either Advantage and Disadvantage roll two d20 when
                    taking the affected action. If they have advantage, they pick the highest
                    roll of the two. If they have Disadvantage, they pick the lowest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br/>
                    Uniqueness is a compromise. This means that you choose that players cannot
                    get more than one bonus to the same action because there isn&#8217;t one.
                    This is the only one. An example of this is the bless spell in Dungeons and
                    Dragons.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Bless is a volatile bonus, I lasts only one minute or until the caster
                    breaks their concentration. And it reads:
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    You bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a
                    target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the
                    target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving
                    throw.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    This means that when they roll or try to save, they roll a d20 + an
                    additional d4. This bonus is not only unique because it&#8217;s the only
                    bonus (that I&#8216;m aware of) that applies to attack rolls, it&#8217;s
                    also significant, because the player is rolling an additional die. And
                    it&#8217;s not a complete subsystem like Advantage, it&#8217;s a relatively
                    small bonus, and if there were multiple of these, players would have to
                    remember to roll for all of them and keep track of them at the same time
                    (the Concentration mechanic also helps here). But because this is the only
                    one, people roll a d20, add the static modifier and ask, do we have bless?
                    And whatever the answer, they move on to advantage.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    So what did this mean for my version of PTU? It meant getting rid of
                    volatile and situational bonuses and replacing them with significant and
                    unique ones. Did I achieve that? Partially. I added an advantage system and
                    that helped to get rid of the attack bonuses, but since I was trying to
                    keep the amount of content the same, it meant that it was hard to ensure
                    uniqueness, and I failed at that. Taking one step forward would be by
                    cutting content. There are a lot of Moves and Abilities, and they add
                    uniqueness to the pokemon themselves, but also add complexity to the game.
                </p>

                <h2 dir="ltr">
                    Combat Stages, a Volatile System
                </h2>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Here is another compromise I had to make. One I'm not entirely satisfied
                    with.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Combat stages is a core mechanic in the pokemon games, and PTU has most, if
                    not all, of those in their rules, plus some extras (like injuries). They
                    are not 1 to 1 translations, they are adaptations and pretty good ones at
                    that. Combat stages in the pokemon games are multipliers to pokemon stats.
                    Multiplication is a basic operation, but not the most basic. So I replaced
                    the multiplication part with addition.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    But combat stages vary throughout a battle. They are affected by Moves and
                    abilities and features. They are volatile and, as established, crunchy. So
                    I should remove it, right?
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Well, here is the issue, Combat Stages is too much of a core mechanic of
                    pokemon games. One solution was to turn the most important buff Moves into
                    unique and iconic Buffs. Like Haste or Barkskin in D&amp;D. But this meant
                    cuttin other moves, which is something I didn&#8217;t want to do.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    So Combat Stages stayed. I'm pretty sure they are the only volatile bonus
                    remaining (except for some abilities I failed to translate), and they are a
                    core mechanic of the game, but still, it takes up headspace, and makes the
                    game a bit more crunchy.

                </h2>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Some RPGs have skills, they represent your capabilities outside of combat.
                    Are you good at bartering? How much do you know about the world? If you try
                    to be charming, what are your chances of actually succeeding? All of these
                    are also represented in PTU.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Skills had some issues that increased the game&#8217;s complexity and
                    crunchiness. Skills, here, affected many things. And example would be that
                    to calculate how many spaces a character could move on the board they had
                    to average their athletics and acrobatics skills together. Skills also
                    influenced your carry capacity, which should be ok, but the thing that
                    affected crunchiness the most was Edges.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Edges are small, unique and flavorful abilities used to spice up a
                    character. Most Edges had an influence over combat, or you could spend
                    edges to level up a skill on a 1-to-1 basis. A player character acquired 4
                    edges at level 1 and 1 every other level thereafter. This meant that
                    players had to make a few choices at the first level only. And some other
                    while leveling up. But there were two issues here. One is that they
                    weren&#8217;t really impactful or powerful. This is a common pattern in
                    crunchier systems, where characters and their power level are actually sums
                    of smaller choices and bonuses.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The other issue laid with the other choice system. Features. On the levels
                    you didn&#8217;t gain an edge, you earned a Feature. Features were more
                    powerful, approximately twice as much, than an Edge. But to qualify for a
                    Feature you generally had to meet some requirements. Those requirements
                    came, generally in the form of Skills, and some requirements where pretty
                    tight. This meant that you had to plan your skills ahead of time if you
                    wanted to hit the Features you wanted, and that took some time.

                <br/>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    So how to solve this? Cut the edges. Players get a skill point every two
                    levels and I buffed some iconic Edges and turned them into Features.
                    Features were also grouped by classes and you could take them in any order.
                    I removed that as well, classes are now more linear and allow fewer choices
                    but the process is more streamlined (classes sort of had a dependency path
                    already so it wasn&#8217;t that hard).

                    Attack AC
                </h3>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Simplifying, all moves had a penalty to their attack roll. It was,
                    generally, -2. So I got rid of the penalty. I thought about increasing
                    defense by +2 for everyone, but in the end I just ditched it. Moves with
                    higher penalties now roll with Disadvantage (roll twice, pick worse).

                    Tutor Points
                </h3>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Pokemon had these points that allowed them to learn extra moves and
                    abilities outside of the ones they could learn by leveling up. I removed
                    them. These points were a throttle to avoid players teaching too many of
                    these to their pokemon, but there were already some other throttlers in
                    place, in addition to these points, so I had to be careful, but I thought I
                    could do without them.

                <p dir="ltr">
                    Another throttler. This time it&#8217;s for player characters. Some
                    abilities were too powerful and thus had to be limited and had their usage
                    weighed against other abilities. I decided to balance them via the
                    Frequency mechanic instead.

                    It was going over every Feature, Ability and Move in the game. Adapt it and
                    rework it if necessary. I still keep the ones that I couldn&#8217;t make
                    work in my notes. If you want to look for them, they are volatile.

                    This is more of a house rule, but tracking all 6 pokemon per player might
                    be too much, so in my playgroup we limit it.

                    If you want to check out my version of PTU, there is a link below for it as
                    well as for the companion spreadsheet. Both are required. In the document
                    you will find the core rules and Features and in the spreadsheet
                    there&#8217;s the list of all items, abilities and moves. If you want to
                    play, it&#8217;s better if you are familiar with the original and willing
                    to make your own changes to these rules, since, as I mentioned above, this
                    wasn't playtested.

                    The only dependency of my ruleset to the older ruleset is the Pokedex PDF
                    which you will have to download from the original rules package (also
                    linked below). Instructions on how to use it are in the Pokemon Progression
                    section of my document.

                    It was a long but fun project. It is not complete, but it is ready to
                    playtest. Sadly I never got to playtest it with my group. Someday I might,
                    or, most likely, I'll build a softer system from the ground up, making
                    compromises on my own terms.
